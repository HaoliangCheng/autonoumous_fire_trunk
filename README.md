# Autonoumous Firefighting Trunk

## Project Description

This project involves designing an automatic vehicle capable of extinguishing fires in areas too dangerous for human firefighters, such as forests. The vehicle operates autonomously without human control, using programmed code within a micro-chip controller. It can detect obstacles and navigate around them using distance sensors and respond to high temperatures or fire by spraying water from its onboard tank.

## Table of Elements

| Element                     | Description                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Three Distance Sensors      | Measure the distance between obstacles and the vehicle from the front, left, and right directions to detect barriers. |
| Three Temperature Sensors   | Measure the location of the fire source to determine the vehicle's final destination.           |
| One Water Weight Sensor     | Measures the amount of water in the tank to decide if the vehicle needs to return for resupply. |
| Water-pump                  | Pumps water from the tank to extinguish the fire.                                               |
| Water Gun Motor             | Rotates the water gun horizontally and adjusts the elevation angle.                             |
| Two-degree Wheels with Drive Motors | Drive the vehicle.                                                                       |
| 2 LED Lights                | Indicate whether there is enough water in the tank.                                             |
